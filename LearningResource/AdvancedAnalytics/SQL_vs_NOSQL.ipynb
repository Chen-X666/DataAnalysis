        "\n",

SQLite is a great utility: It allows creating efficient databases on-the-fly, and it is oriented towards apps, applications, and in-place data analytics. A great summary of case uses for SQLite can be found [here](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html).\n",

We will only see some of the tutorial activities today, so I advice you to go to [the SQLite tutorial](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/) and go through some of the most advanced characteristics, and also go through the full [SQL reference on W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_quickref.asp)."
